Once upon a time, in a bright, cheerful forest, a little squirrel named Squeaky was looking for his favorite acorn. He had buried it under the big oak tree, but he couldn't remember exactly where.

"Oh no! What if I lost it?" Squeaky said, twitching his tail.

His friend, Bella the bluebird, flew down and chirped, "Don't worry, Squeaky! I'll help you search!"

They asked their friend, Rolo the rabbit, to join them. Together, they looked under leaves, behind rocks, and inside tree stumps. Just as Squeaky began to feel sad, Bella spotted a shiny acorn hidden under some moss.

"There it is!" Bella chirped.

Squeaky squealed with joy. "Thank you, friends! I couldn't have done it without you!"

They celebrated by sharing the acorn and nibbling on berries together. From then on, Squeaky always remembered that friends make everything better.
